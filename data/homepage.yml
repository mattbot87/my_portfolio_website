  title: "Who am I?"
  content:
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>Driven by a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights</strong>, 
    I am a Senior Business Analyst at Abbott, specializing in leveraging data to drive significant business improvements. 
    My expertise in data analysis and automation, honed over three years in the labeling department, 
    has been pivotal in advancing initiatives such as the Universal Addendum Labeling project and 
    supporting the Abbott Diagnostics team. With a proficiency in R programming, 
    I create impactful dashboards, scripts, and reports that synchronize data insights with strategic business objectives.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My journey began</strong> in retail management, where I cultivated key skills in communication, leadership, 
    and strategic problem-solving. This foundational experience seamlessly transitioned into my data analysis career, 
    where I consistently apply these skills to tackle complex data challenges. Further enriching my expertise, 
    I pursued a Master of Science in Applied Economics from the University of Minnesota, deepening my knowledge in statistics, 
    machine learning, and data visualization.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Today, as I aspire to transition into a data scientist role, I am passionate about employing my skills in R and 
    econometrics to foster innovation and unearth critical insights for business growth. My commitment lies in 
    leveraging my analytical capabilities to make a lasting impact in the field of data science, continuously 
    seeking new challenges and opportunities for professional growth and contribution.
